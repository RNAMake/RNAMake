Builds a path out of RNA from one basepair to another. 

./path_builder_new -pdb ~/Downloads/4v9d_26A_nointermittent-1.pdb -end_bp A1449-A1454 -start_bp C2856-C2861

options:

-pdb : the pdb that contains the scaffold structure 
-start_bp : the name of the basepair you will be building from
-end_bp : the name of the basepair you are building too
-write_pdbs : bool switch, controls whether pdbs of the solutions will be generated. 
	make sure to also open the scaffold.pdb so solutions are in proper orienation
-no_sterics : bool switch, shuts off strikes
-out : controls the file to output results to, default: “default.out”

search options
-search::accept_score : (float) controls what is considered a solution, default 10
-search::max_solutions : (int) the max number of solutions, default 1
-search::max_size : (int) the max number of residues that can be in a solution default : 1000000
-search::max_node_level : (int) the max number of motifs that can be included default : 12
-search::min_node_level : (int) the minimum number of motifs that can be included default : 0
