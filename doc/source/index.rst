Welcome to RNAMake's documentation!
===================================

RNAMake is a toolkit for designing and optimizing RNA 3D structure. It allows the alignment between RNA motifs. These motif are small modular peices of RNA that are believed to fold independently, thus attaching them together with helix flanking both sides allows users of RNAMake to build large segments of RNA with a high success rate of forming the predicted structure in vitro.
