++ Getting started

Install Aptana studio 3

Install python 2.7

http://www.scipy.org/Download#head-e68e4e32955ab584e1ac94e2b767f00179eac137

Install Numpy, SciPy


++ Installing ViennaRNA

Windows - you can simply use the binary that's already in the directory "vienna_windows_binaries"
Others - Unfortunately, you'll have to compile ViennaRNA yourself. Download Vienna RNA source package

http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/ViennaRNA-1.8.5.tar.gz

compile them and then put them in the "vienna_[your_platform]_binaries"

then change a line in eterna_utils.py

os.system("echo " + sequence + " | .\\vienna_windows_binaries\\RNAfold.exe -p > rnafold_dump")

to use the compiled binaries



++ Testing your strategy

run_strategy.py strategies/your_strategy.py



++ To re-optimize

Every strategy will run optimization, then save the optimized parameters in params directory. It won't run optimization again as long as the params file is there. If you want to reoptimize the strategy,

run_strategy.py strategies/your_strategy.py OPTIMIZE


++ To cross validate


run_strategy.py strategies/your_strategy.py CROSS



++ Submitting your strategy

Mark self.publishable_ = true in your strategy py file

run_strategy.py strategies/your_strategy.py PUBLISH
