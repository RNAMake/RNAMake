# Coloring scheme for chains in "blocview" generated images.
# This list contains one-letter chain-ID and corresponding color name
#      which should be one of MolScript's 164 pre-defined names stored
#      in file "mcolname.dat". Otherwise, the default color corresponding
#      to "*" at the end is used.
# 0-9 are assigned the same color as A-J
# Users might change colors here or add new chains and their colors
