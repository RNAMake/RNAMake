[1] Atomic_?.pdb (? = A, C, G, T or U) 

      Default standard residue geometries used by 3DNA for analyzing
      and rebuilding full atomic nucleic acid structures in PDB
      format.
		  
      Under the subdirectory atomic/, there are four sets of standard
      residue geometry files, ADNA_?.pdb, BDNA_?.pdb, NDB96_?.pdb and
      RNA_?.pdb. The base geometries by Clowney et al. (1996) are used
      throughout and they were downloaded from the NDB archive. The
      NDB96 set includes just base and C1' atoms, without backbone.
      The ADNA set uses the C3'-endo sugar-backbone conformation as
      defined by Arnott's fiber studies, but with a chi torsion angle
      of -160 degrees, average of high resolution single crystal X-ray
      oligonucleotide structures. The RNA set is the same as the ADNA
      set except for an additional O2' atom for each nucleotide. The
      BDNA set is similarly defined as the ADNA set except for the
      -110 degrees chi torsion angle.

      The NDB96 set is the default. To use another set, simply copy
      them to overwrite the corresponding Atomic_?.pdb. A utility
      program, "x3dna_utils cp_std", can do this automatically for
      you. Other residue geometries can be used with the utility
      program "std_base".

[2] Block_BP.alc -- it defines the default base-pair rectangular
      block. It has a size of [10 A (long) -by- 4.5 A (wide) -by- 0.5
      A (thick)] and is in ALCHEMY format. It is used for the
      Calladine-Drew style schematic presentation of DNA structures.

    Block_R.alc is for the purine base [4.5 -by- 4.5 -by- 0.5]
    Block_Y.alc is for the pyrimidine base [3.0 -by- 4.5 -by- 0.5]

      Under the subdirectory block/, there six block geometry files.
      Block_M.alc has half the size of BLOCK_BP.alc, and can be used
      if you would like the two blocks in a base-pair to be of the
      same size. Block_Ms.alc is slightly smaller in length than
      Block_M.alc to avoid possible overlaps in a compressed base-pair
      (i.e. with negative stretch). The blocks do not necessarily to
      be rectangular, as shown in Block_R_nr.alc.

[3] Pxyz.dat -- the xyz coordinates of phosphorus (P) atoms with
      regard to the middle dinucleotide reference frame. Four sets
      were defined, corresponding to average values in high resolution
      A- and B-DNA crystal structures, their mean value, and TA-DNA.
      Users can add new sets following the format. This file is used
      by "rebuild" for generating DNA structures with only base and P
      atoms.

    PxyzH.dat is the same as above except the coordinates are given in
      the middle helical frames.

[4] fig_image.par -- parameters to style the generated XFig files,
      which can be edited by users to suit their needs.

[5] ps_image.par -- parameters to define the style of the generated
      EPS files, which can be edited by users to suit their needs.

[6] baselist.dat -- a comprehensive list of currently known
    nucleotides and their standard counterparts. It makes the analysis
    of unusual DNA and RNA structures straightforward

[7] misc_3dna.par -- geometric parameters for identifying base-pairs
    and locating helical regions, mainly used by the "find_pair"
    program.

[8] my_header.r3d -- sample header file for Raster3D output
    my_header_hres.r3d -- output 160 * 16 pixel high-resolution image
    raster3d.par -- various styling parameters for Raster3d output

[9] The directory RNA_bases/ contains the standard bases for
     calculating Babcock and Olson's authentic "RNA" base-pair
     parameters (use "cehs" with "-r" option).
