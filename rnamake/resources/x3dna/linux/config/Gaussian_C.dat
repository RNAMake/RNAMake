# Matched atom-pairs in sequential order (per Gaussian), separated by
# white space. The left-column are the elemental symbols based on the
# PDB file created with Gaussian-Babel, and the right-column are the
# corresponding standard PDB atom names. Each atom symbol/name must be
# 4-character long with space substituted by underscore (i.e., ' ' to
# '_'). No hydrogens atoms should be included. Empty lines and those
# starting with # are ignored.

# The list here contains only base atoms, and backbone atoms can be
# easily added by keeping the proper *order*. Just remember to use '
# instead of * for sugar atoms; e.g. the line for C1' atom should be:
# _C__  _C1'

_N__  _N1_    # 1
_C__  _C6_    # 2
_C__  _C5_    # 3
_C__  _C4_    # 4
_N__  _N4_    # 5
_N__  _N3_    # 6
_C__  _C2_    # 7
_O__  _O2_    # 8
