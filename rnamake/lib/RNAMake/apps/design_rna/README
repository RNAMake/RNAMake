Builds a path out of RNA from one basepair to another. 

./design_rna -pdb ~/Downloads/native_plus_motif_1.pdb -start_bp "B4-B16" -end_bp "C1-C6" -no_segment -pdbs -verbose -search.accept_score 22 -optimizer.cutoff 12

options:

-pdb : the pdb that contains the scaffold structure 
-start_bp : the name of the basepair you will be building from
-end_bp : the name of the basepair you are building too
-pdbs : bool switch, controls whether pdbs of the solutions will be generated. 
	make sure to also open the scaffold.pdb so solutions are in proper orienation
-no_segment: bool switch, does not segment RNA before design
-designs: number of total sequences to produce
-verbose: prints lots of info while building
-only_ideal: no sequence optimization

search options
-search.accept_score : (float) controls what is considered a solution, default 10
-search.max_solutions : (int) the max number of solutions, default 1
-search.max_size : (int) the max number of residues that can be in a solution default : 1000000
-search.max_node_level : (int) the max number of motifs that can be included default : 12
-search,min_node_level : (int) the minimum number of motifs that can be included default : 0

Sequence optimizer options
-optimizer.cutoff : (float)
