RNAMake
=======

**RNAMake** is a toolkit for designing and optimizing RNA 3D structure. It allows 
the alignment between RNA motifs. These motif are small modular peices of RNA that are 
believed to fold independently, thus attaching them together with helix flanking both 
sides allows users of **RNAMake** to build large segments of RNA with a high success 
rate of forming the predicted structure in vitro.
